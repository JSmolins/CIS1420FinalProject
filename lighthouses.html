        <h3>Point Iroquois Lighthouse</h3>
        <p>In 1975, The Point Iroquois Lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Visit with the volunteer hosts in the museum to learn more about life as it once was in a lighthouse on Lake Superior. Climb the spiral staircase to the top of the 65 ft. tower, open to the public during certain viewing hours.</p>

        <h3>Crisp Point Lighthouse</h3>
        <p>Crisp's Point Lighthouse is located on the deserted shore of Lake Superior, just 37 miles north of Newberry, Michigan. Crisp's Point Lighthouse is considered one of the most inaccessible and lonely mainland lighthouses in the Upper Peninsula, yet can be reached by taking a narrow country road through the Lake Superior State Forest.</p>

        <h3>Au Sable Light Station</h3>
        <p>The Au Sable Light Station was originally called the Big Sable Light Station. The name was changed in May 1910 to conform to its geographic location on Lake Superior. The term Au Sable is French for "with sand", presumably named by early European explorers.</p>
